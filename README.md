ST2 Hyperlink Helper
====================

a port of [TextMate’s][textmate] Hyperlink Helper bundle for [Sublime Text 2][st2]

What is this?
-------------

ST2 Hyperlink Helper is a collection of commands for the [Sublime Text 2][st2] text editor for Windows, OS X, and Linux. These commands make it super easy to insert hyperlinks into documents of various kinds (including HTML, Markdown) using shortcut.

Currently supported languages:

  * HTML
  * Markdown
  * Textile
  * LaTeX
  * DokuWiki (once Sublime Text 2 has a DokuWiki language file added to it)

Currently offered commands:

  * Lookup with Google & Link

At this time, there are no menus or key bindings assigned to these commands (there will be soon). You can invoke the commands from the Command Palette (Tools > Command Palette), or assign your own menu items or keyboard shortcuts in your User Key Bindings file.

Why is this needed?
-------------------

Hyperlink Helper is one of the most popular features of [TextMate][tm] a popular text editor for the Mac. In many ways, [Sublime Text 2][st2] is a superior editor to TextMate, but it lacks many of the convenience features that make TextMate so popular. This project is an effort to bring some of those features to Sublime Text 2.

How do I install this?
----------------------

Download the code for this project and drop it into a subdirectory of Sublime Text 2’s Packages folder. You can get to the Packages folder by choosing **Browse Packages…** from Sublime Text 2’s **Preferences** menu.

Project Status
--------------

This project is currently alpha. Functionality is largely incomplete, but what’s there works to a useful standard.
